# Ivan's Second Brain

## Introduction
- Obsidian is probably the best note taking tool ever created. It's allowed me to make connections between notes that I could not have done using traditional note taking tools (mmh... pen and paper)
- I've been using it for a lot of things like [[Leetcode]], school notes and personal notes

## Juicy Stuff
- if you want your notes to look like mine(kinda hard to know what they look like since you can only see them as they are on Github), this is everything that I have added to make my note taking experience better

### Community Plugins
- *Tasks* - helps me format my todos
- *Git* - the best life saver for helping me commit and push my notes to my repo. Can't believe I used to do this manually
- *Calendar* - just a simple calendar. Don't really use it much
- *Colored Tags* - makes my tags look better :)
- *File Explorer Note Count* - tells me the number of words and characters in a specific file

### Theme
- *Obsidian gruvbox* - best theme hands down
