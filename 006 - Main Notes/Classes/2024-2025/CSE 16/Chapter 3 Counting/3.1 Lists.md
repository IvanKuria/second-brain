## Lists
- a [[list]] is an ordered sequence of objects
- Denoted using parentheses (a1, a2, ..., an)
	- E.g. $${(a, b, c, d, e)} \neq {(b, a, c, d, e)}$$
	- *Duplicates* are allowed
- Two lists are equal if they have exactly the *same entries* in exactly the *same positions.*

### Empty List
- the [[empty list]] is denoted using ()

### String
- A list of symbols written without parentheses and commas is called a [[string]].
	- E.g. *HHTHTTTHHT*
