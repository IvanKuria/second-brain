# Proof by Contradiction

## Example
- *Proposition* Every non-zero rational number can be expressed as a product of two irrational numbers. Reworded as " *If r is a non-zero rational number, then r is a product of two irrational numbers.*"
	- *Proof* Suppose $r$ is a non-zero rational number. Then $r = a b$ for integers $a$ and $b$. Also, $r$ can be written as a product of two numbers as follows:
	$$r = \sqrt{2}*\frac{r}{\sqrt2}$$
	-  *Assume* for the sake of contradiction that $\frac{r}{\sqrt2}$ is rational. 
	- *This* means:
	$$\frac{r}{\sqrt2} = \frac{c}{d}$$
	- for integers $c$ and $d$, so
	$$\sqrt{2} = r\frac{d}{c}$$
	- *But* we know $r = a b$ , which combines with the above equation to give:
	$$\sqrt{2} = r\frac{d}{c} = \frac{a}{b}*\frac{d}{c} = \frac{ad}{bc}$$
	- *This* means $\sqrt2$ is rational, which is a contradiction because we know it is irrational.
	- *Therefore* $\frac{r}{\sqrt2}$ is irrational
	- Hence $r = \sqrt{2}*\frac{r}{\sqrt2}$ is a product of two irrational numbers
