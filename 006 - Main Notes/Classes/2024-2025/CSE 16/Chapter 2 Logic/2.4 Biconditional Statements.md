# Logic


- The statement ${P}\rightarrow{Q}$ doesn't necessarily mean that ${Q}\rightarrow{P}$. Suppose that ${a}$ is some integer and consider the statements:
	- (a is a multiple of 6) $\rightarrow$ (a is divisible by 2), 
	- (a is divisible by 2) $\rightarrow$ (a is a multiple of 6).
		- The first statement is true while the second one is false.
- Sometimes the *converse* is true.
	- (a is even)  $\rightarrow$  (a is divisible by 2),
	- (a is divisible by 2)  $\rightarrow$ (a is even)
		- Since both ${P}\rightarrow{Q}$  and${Q}\rightarrow{P}$ are true, it follows that  (${P}\rightarrow{Q}$)  $\wedge$ (${Q}\rightarrow{P}$) is true.
- The symbol for a [[biconditional statement]] is $\iff$ which is read as *if and only if*
	- E.g. ${P}\iff{Q}$
