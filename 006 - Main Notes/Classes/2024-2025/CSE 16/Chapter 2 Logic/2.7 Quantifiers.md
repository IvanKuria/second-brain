## Quantifier Symbols

### 1. For All
- [[for all]] this is represented by the symbol  ∀
	- E.g. “Every element of ${X}$ is odd.” => 
		$${∀}{x} \in {X} {,}\space \mathbb{P}{(x)}$$
- The format above is referred to as the [[universal quantification]]
### 2. There Exists
- [[there exists]] is represented by the symbol  ∃
	- E.g. “There is at least one element of ${X}$ that is odd,”
		$${∃}{x} \in {X} {,}\space \mathbb{P}{(x)}$$
- The format above is referred to as the [[existential quantification]]

## Nested Quantifiers
- E.g. ${S}_n$ , ${n} \in \mathbb{N}$ :
	- ${S}_n$ = ${1/n}$ 
${∀}\epsilon \in {(0, \infty)},$ there exists n in N, for all m >= n| |Sn - 0| < epsilon => True
#### Negation
- there exists epsilon in (0, infinity), ~ (there exists n in N, for all m >=n, |Sn - 0| < epsilon)
- there exists epsilon in (0, infinity), for all n in N, ~(or all m >=n, |Sn - 0| < epsilon)
- there exists epsilon in (0, infinity), for all n in N, there exists m >= n, |Sn - 0| >= epsilon
