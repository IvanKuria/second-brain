# Logic
## Introduction
- [[logic]] is a process of deducing information correctly, not just deducing correct information.

## Statements
- a [[statement]] is a sentence or a mathematical expression that is either definitely true or definitely false.
	- E.g. *If a circle has radius r, then its area is πr 2 square units.* => True
	- E.g. *All right triangles are isosceles.* => False
- Statements can be expressed as letters
	- E.g. ${P}$ : For every integer ${n}$ > 1, the number ${2n}$ −1 is prime

### Open Sentences 
- a sentence whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables, is called an [[open sentence]]
	- E.g. ${R(f, g)}$ : The function ${f}$ is the derivative of the function ${g}$.
