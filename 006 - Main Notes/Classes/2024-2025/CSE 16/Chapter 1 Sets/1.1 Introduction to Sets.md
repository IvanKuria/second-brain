# Sets
## Intro
- A  [[set]] is a collection of things(elements)
	- E.g.: A =  {1, 2, 3, 4} => [[RosterNotation]]
- If an element is in a set it's denoted as 1 ∈ A(using prev example)
- Sets are considered equal if they contain the same elements
	- E.g.: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {2, 1, 3, 4} ∴ A = B => order doesn't matter( basically a python set)
	- Duplicates also don't affect equivalence
		- E.g.: A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {1, 1, 3, 2, 4} ∴ A = B
### Special Sets
- [[Natural Numbers]]  = ℕ = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...}
- [[Integers]] = ℤ = {...,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,4,...}
- [[Empty Set]] = {} or *∅*
- [[Real Numbers]] = sqrt(2) ∈ $\mathbb{R}$
- Rational Numbers = [[Q]] = *{i / n: n ∈ N, i ∈ Z}*

### Set properties
- Size or [[cardinality]] is the number of elements it has, and this number is denoted as |X|.
	- E.g.: X = {1, 2, ,3, 4} , *|X|* = 4
	- E.g.: |N| = ∞
	- E.g.: |∅| = 0
#### Question
- If n ∈ Z then n + 1 ∈ Z and n - 1 ∈ Z(*False*)
- If n ∈ Z then n + 1 ∈ Z(*True*)

### Other Notation
#### Set builder
- [[set builder]] refers to a way to denote a series of elements that cannot be enclosed within {}
	- E.g.: *E = {...,−6,−4,−2,0,2,4,6,...}* (set of all real even numbers)
		- Set builder notation = *E = {2n : n ∈ Z }*
- Notation: { _ : condition(s)}
	- _  = prototype
	- : = read such that
	
- E.g.: *{n: n ∈ N and n <= 5 }* => {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

##### Rational Numbers
- E.g.: [[Q]] = *{i / n: n ∈ N, i ∈ Z}*
