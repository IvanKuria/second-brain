# Proving Non-Conditional Statements

## Existence Statements
- [[existence statements]] are statements that take the form $\exists x, \mathbb{R}{x}$

## Existence  Theorems
- [[existence theorems]] are theorems that take the form $\exists x, \mathbb{R}{x}$

### Example
- *Proposition* There exists an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two perfect cubes in two different ways.
	- *Proof*. Consider the number $1729$. Note that $1^3 + 12^3 = 1729$ and $9^3 + 10^3 = 1729$. Thus the number $1729$ can be expressed as the sum of two perfect cubes in two different ways.
