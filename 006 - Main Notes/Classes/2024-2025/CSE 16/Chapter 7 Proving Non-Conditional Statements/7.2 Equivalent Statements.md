# Proving Non-Conditional Statements

## Theorem 
- *Suppose* $A$ is an $n × n$ matrix. The following statements are equivalent: 
	- (a) The matrix $A$ is invertible. 
	- (b) The equation $Ax = b$ has a unique solution for every $b ∈ Rn$. 
	- (c) The equation $Ax = 0$ has only the trivial solution. 
	- (d) The reduced row echelon form of $A$ is In. 
	- (e) $det(A) \neq 0$. 
	- (f) The matrix $A$ does not have 0 as an eigenvalue. 
- One approach to proving the theorem about the n × n matrix would be to prove the conditional statement ($a) ⇒ (b$), then $(b) ⇒ (c)$, then $(c) ⇒ (d)$, then $(d) ⇒ (e)$, then ($e) ⇒ ( f )$ and finally $(f) ⇒ (a)$.
