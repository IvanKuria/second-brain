# Functions

## Function
- Suppose $A$ and $B$ are sets. A [[function]] $f$ from $A$ to $B$ (denoted as $f : A → B$) is a relation $f ⊆ A × B$ from $A$ to $B$, satisfying the property that for each $a ∈ A$ the [[relation]] $f$ contains exactly one ordered pair of form $(a, b)$. The statement $(a, b) ∈ f$ is abbreviated $f (a) = b$.
