# Logic

## Logical Inference
- From two true statements we infer that a third statement is true. This is [[logical inference]]
	- E.g. By itself, ${P} \Rightarrow {Q}$ being true does not tell us that either P or Q is true (they could both be false, or P could be false and Q true). But if in addition we happen to know that P is true, then Q *must be true.*
