# Sets

## Intro
- elements from one set can be found in another [[set]]
	- E.g. A = { 0,2,4 } is also an element of B = { 0,1,2,3,4 }. When A and B are related this way we say that A is a [[subset]] of B
	-  *A $\subseteq$ B*
- the opposite is also true
	- E.g. *A $\nsubseteq$ B*
### Proper Subset
- if ${A} \subseteq {B}$ and A $\neq$ B, we say A is a [[proper subset]] of B

### Formal Definition
- Suppose A and B are sets. If every element of A is also an element of B, then we say A is a [[subset]] of B, and we denote this as A $\subseteq$ B. We write A $\subseteq$ B if A is not a [[subset]] of B, that is, if it is not true that every element of A is also an element of B. Thus A $\nsubseteq$ B means that there is at least one element of A that is not an element of B

### Fact
- The [[Empty Set]] is a [[subset]] of all sets, that is, $\emptyset$ âŠ† B for any [[set]] B

### Fact
- If a finite [[set]] has n elements, then it has 2$^n$ [[subset]]s.
