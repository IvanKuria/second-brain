# Sets

## Complement

### Universal Set
- it refers to the [[set]] that some set ${A}$ that contains all the elements of ${A}$
	- E.g. Prime numbers, $\mathbb{P}$ = { 2,3,5,7,11,13,... } $\subseteq$ $\mathbb{N}$ with $\mathbb{N}$ being the [[universal set]]

### Complement Def
 - Let ${A}$ be a set with a universal set ${U}$. The [[complement]] of ${A}$ denoted $\overline{A}$, is the set $\overline{A}$= ${U}$ − ${A}$.
	 - $\overline{A}$ = {x: x $\in$ ${U}$ - ${A}$}

### Examples
- If ${P}$ is the set of prime numbers, then,
	- $\overline{P}$ = $\mathbb{N}$− ${P}$ = { 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,... }

### Order of Operations
1. complements
2. intersections
3. unions
4. differences

### Examples
$\overline{A \cap B} = \overline{A} \cup \overline{B}$
