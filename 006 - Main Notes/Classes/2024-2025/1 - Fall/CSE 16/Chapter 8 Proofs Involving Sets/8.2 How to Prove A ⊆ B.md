# Proofs Involving Sets

## Introduction
- Recall (Definition 1.3) that if $A$ and $B$ are sets, then $A ⊆ B$ means that every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. In other words, it means if $a ∈ A$, then $a ∈ B$. 
- Therefore to prove that $A ⊆ B$, we just need to prove that the conditional statement “*If a ∈ A, then a ∈ B*” is true.

### Example
- *Prove* that $\{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\} ∩ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\} ⊆ \{x ∈ Z : 6 | x\}$ 
	- *Proof*. Suppose $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\} ∩ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\}$ . 
	- *By definition* of intersection, this means $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\}$ and $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\}$. 
	- *Since* $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\}$ we know $2 | a$, so $a = 2c$ for some $c ∈ Z$. 
	- *Thus* a is even. Since $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\}$ we know $9 | a$, so $a = 9d$ for some $d ∈ Z$. 
	- *As* a is even, $a = 9d$ implies $d$ is even. (Otherwise $a = 9d$ would be odd.) 
	- *Then* $d = 2e$ for some integer $e$, and we have $a = 9d = 9(2e) = 6(3e)$. 
	- *From* $a = 6(3e)$, we conclude $6 | a$, and this means $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 6 | x\}$. 
- We have shown that $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\} ∩ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\}$ implies $a ∈ \{x ∈ Z : 6 | x\}$, so it follows that $\{x ∈ Z : 2 | x\} ∩ \{x ∈ Z : 9 | x\} ⊆ \{x ∈ Z : 6 | x\}$.
