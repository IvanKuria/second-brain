# Proofs Involving Sets

## Example
- Let’s investigate elements of $A = \{x : x \in \mathbb{N} \wedge 7 | x\}$. 
- This [[set]] has form $A = {x : P(x)}$ where $P(x)$ is the [[open sentence]] $(x ∈ N) ∧ (7 | x)$. 
- Thus $21 ∈ A$ because $P(21)$ is true. 
- Similarly, $7, 14, 28, 35$, etc., are all elements of $A$. But $8 ∉ A$ (for example) because $P(8)$ is false. 
- Likewise $−14 ∉ A$ because $P(−14)$ is false.
