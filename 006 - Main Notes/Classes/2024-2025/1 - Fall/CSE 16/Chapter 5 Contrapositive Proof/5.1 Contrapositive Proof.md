# Contrapositive Proof

## Introduction
- Like direct proof, the technique of contrapositive proof is used to prove conditional statements of the form “If $P$, then $Q$.” 
- Although it is possible to use direct proof exclusively, there are occasions where contrapositive proof is much easier.

### Example
- *Proposition* Suppose $x \in Z$. If $7x + 9$ is even, then $x$ is odd. 
	- *Proof*. (Contrapositive) Suppose $x$ is not odd. 
	- *Thus* $x$ is even, so $x = 2a$ for some integer $a$. 
	- *Then* $7x + 9 = 7(2a) + 9 = 14a + 8 + 1 = 2(7a + 4) + 1$. 
	- *Therefore* $7x + 9 = 2b + 1$, where $b$ is the integer $7a + 4$. 
	- *Consequently* $7x + 9$ is odd. 
	- *Therefore* $7x + 9$ is not even. 


### Example
- *Proposition* Suppose $x ∈ Z$. If $x^2 − 6x + 5$ is even, then $x$ is odd. 
	- *Proof*. (Contrapositive) Suppose $x$ is not odd. 
	- *Thus* $x$ is even, so $x = 2a$ for some integer $a$. 
	- *So* $x^2−6x+5 = (2a)^2−6(2a)+5 = 4a^2−12a+5 = 4a^2−12a+4+1 = 2(2a^2−6a+2)+1$. 
	- *Therefore* $x^2 − 6x + 5 = 2b + 1$, where b is the integer $2a^2 − 6a + 2$. 
	- *Consequently* $x^2 − 6x + 5$ is odd. 
	- *Therefore* $x^2 − 6x + 5$ is not even.
