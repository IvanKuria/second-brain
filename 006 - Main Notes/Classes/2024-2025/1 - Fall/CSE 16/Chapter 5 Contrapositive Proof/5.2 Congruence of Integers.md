# Contrapositive Proof

## Congruent Modulo n
- Given integers $a$ and $b$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are [[congruent modulo]] $n$ if $n | (a − b)$. We express this as $a \equiv b$ (mod n). If $a$ and $b$ are not congruent modulo $n$, we write this as $a \not\equiv b$ (mod n).

### Examples
1. $9 \equiv 1$ (mod 4) because $4 | (9 − 1)$. 
2. $6 \equiv 10$ (mod 4) because $4 | (6 − 10)$. 
3. $14 6 \equiv 8$ (mod 4) because $4 - (14 − 8)$.

- In practical terms, a ≡ b (mod n) means that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. 

### Example 1
- Proposition Let a, b ∈ Z and n ∈ N. If a ≡ b (mod n), then a2 ≡ b2 (mod n). 
	- Proof. Suppose a ≡ b (mod n). 
	- By definition of congruence of integers, this means n | (a − b). 
	- Then by definition of divisibility, there is an integer c for which a − b = nc. 
	- Now multiply both sides of this equation by a + b. 
		- a − b = nc 
		- (a − b)(a + b) = nc(a + b) 
		- a2 − b2 = nc(a + b) 
	- Since c(a + b) ∈ Z, the above equation tells us n | (a2 − b2). 
	- According to Definition 5.1, this gives a2 ≡ b2 (mod n)
