# Direct Proof

## Def 1: Even
- An integer $n$ is *even* if $n = 2a$ for some integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$

## Def 2: Odd
- An integer $n$ is *odd* if $n = 2a$ + 1 for some integer $a \in \mathbb{Z}$

## Def 3: Parity
- Two integers have the same parity if they are both even or they are both odd. Otherwise they have opposite parity.

## Def 4
- Suppose $a$ and b are integers. We say that $a$ divides $b$, written $a | b$, if $b = ac$ for some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$. In this case we also say that $a$ is a divisor of $b$, and that $b$ is a multiple of $a$.
