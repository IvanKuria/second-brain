# Counting

## Factorial
- If ${n}$ is a non-negative integer, then ${n!}$ is the number of lists of length n that can be made from n symbols, without repetition. Thus ${0!}$ = 1 and ${1!}$ = 1. If ${n > 1}$, then ${n!}$ = n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1.

## Permutation
- a [[permutation]] of a set is an arrangement of all of the set’s elements in a row, that is, a list without repetition that uses every element of the set. For example, the permutations of the set ${X}$ = {1, 2, 3} are the six lists:
	- 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
- a [[function]] in python is defined by jsvaskvn

### k-permutation
- Assume a set called ${X}$:
- a [[k-permutation]] is a non-repetitive list made from k elements of X .
#### General Formula
- if $0 \leq k \leq n$
$$\mathbb{P}{(n, k)} = \dfrac{n!}{(n - k)!}$$ 
- *n* is the set and k *is* how many we're choosing

#### Other Formula
- if $k > 0$
$$n!$$
#### Example
- You deal five cards off of a standard 52-card deck, and line them up in a row. How many such lineups are there that either consist of all red cards, or all clubs? 
*Solution*: 
- There are 26 *red cards*. The number of ways to line up five of them is $\mathbb{P}{(26, 5)}$ = 26 · 25 · 24 · 23 · 22 = 7, 893, 600. 
- There are 13 *club cards* (which are black). The number of ways to line up five of them is $\mathbb{P}{(13, 5)}$ = 13 · 12 · 11 · 10 · 9 = 154, 440. 
- By the *addition principle*, the answer to our question is that there are  $\mathbb{P}{(26, 5)}$ + $\mathbb{P}{(13, 5)}$ = 8, 048, 040 lineups that are either all red cards, or all club cards.
