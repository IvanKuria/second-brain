# Counting

- If n and k are integers, then $\binom{n}{k}$ denotes the number of subsets that can be made by choosing $k$ elements from an $n$-element set. We read $\binom{n}{k}$ as “n choose k.” (Some textbooks write $\mathbb{C}{(n, k)}$ instead of $\binom{n}{k}$.)

## Example

### Formula
$$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
$\binom{n}{k}$ = 0 if:
	$k < 0$ or $k > n$ 

#### Example
- How many 5-element subsets of A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} have exactly two even elements?
*Solution*
- First select two of the four even elements from A. There are $\binom{4}{2}$ = 6 ways to do this.
- There are $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10 ways to select three of the five odd elements of A
- By the *multiplication principle*, there are $\binom{4}{2}$$\binom{5}{3}$ = 6 · 10 = 60 ways to select two even and three odd elements from A

#### Example 1
- How many ways are there to deal two 5 card hands and have one leftover pile of 42 cards?
*Solution*
$$\frac{52!}{5! 5!(42)!} = 239 \space Trillion$$
or
##### Multinomial Coefficient
$$\binom{52}{5, 5, 42}$$
#### Example 2
- How many ways to pick a 5 card hand(set) from a 52 card deck so that 47 cards are not in hand?
*Solution*
$$\frac{52!}{5!\space47!} = \binom{52}{5}$$
*Note: 
$$\binom{n}{m} = \binom{n}{n-m}$$

#### Example 3
- How many 5 card hands consist of a straight flush where the Ace can be considered high or low as needed?
*Solution*
- Let L be the set of all possible card values: L = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A}
- Le S be the set of all suits:                             S = {H, D, S, C} 

- __4 ways to pick suit__, __10 cards to pick__(card value: max at 10) = 40
