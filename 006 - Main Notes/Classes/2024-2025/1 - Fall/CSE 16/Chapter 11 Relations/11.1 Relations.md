# Relations

## Introduction
- a [[relation]] on a set $A$ is a subset $R ⊆ A × A$. We often abbreviate the statement $(x, y) ∈ R$ as $xR y$. The statement $(x, y) ∉ R$ is abbreviated as $x\not R y$

### Example
- Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, and consider the following set: $R = { (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1) } ⊆ A × A$. 

- The set $R$ is a relation on $A$, by Definition 11.1. 
- Since $(1, 1) ∈ R$, we have $1R1$. Similarly $2R1$ and $2R2$, and so on. 
- However, notice that (for example) $(3, 4) ∉ R$, so $3\not R4$. Observe that $R$ is the familiar relation ≥ for the set $A$.
