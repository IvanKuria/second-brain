#  Properties of Relations

- Suppose $R$ is a relation on a [[set]] $A$.
## Reflexive
- Relation $R$ is reflexive if $xRx$ for every $x ∈ A$. That is, $R$ is reflexive if $∀ x ∈ A, xRx$

## Symmetric
- Relation $R$ is symmetric if $xRy$ implies $yRx$ for all $x, y ∈ A$. That is, $R$ is symmetric if $∀ x, y ∈ A, xR y ⇒ yRx$.

## Transitive
- Relation $R$ is transitive if whenever $xRy$ and $yRz$, then also $xRz$. That is, $R$ is transitive if $∀ x, y, z ∈ A, ((xRy) ∧ (yRz)) ⇒ xRz$
