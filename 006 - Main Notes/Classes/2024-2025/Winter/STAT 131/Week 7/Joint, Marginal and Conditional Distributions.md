## Joint CDF
- Joint CDF. The joint CDF of r.v.s $X$ and $Y$ is the function $F_{X, Y}$ given by:
$$F_{X, Y}(x, y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y)$$
## Joint PMF
- Joint PMF of a discrete r.v.s X and Y is the function px,y given by
$$\mathbb{p}{x,y}(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y)$$
- If X and Y are independent, then pxy(x, y) = px(x)py(y)
