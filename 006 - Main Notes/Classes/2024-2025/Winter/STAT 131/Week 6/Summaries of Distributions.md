# Median
- We say that is a median of a random variable $X$ if $P(X \leq c) \geq 1/2$  and $P(X \geq c) \geq 1/2$

# Mode
- For a discrete r.v. , we say that is a mode of if it maximizes the PMF: $P(X = c) /geq P(X = x)$ for all $x$.

# Moments
- The $n$th moment of an r.v. $X$ is $E(X^n)$
- Let be an r.v. with mean and variance . For any positive integer : the $n$th moment of $X$ is
