# Independence Cont.

## Independence of 3 Events
- Events $A$, $B$ and $C$ are said to be independent if all the following are true:
$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
$$P(A \cap C) = P(A)P(C)$$
$$P(B \cap C) = P(B)P(C)$$
$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A)P(B)P(C)$$

## Conditional Independence
- Events $A$ and $B$ are said to be conditionally independent given $E$ if:
$$P(A \cap B | E) = P(A|E)P(B|E)$$
