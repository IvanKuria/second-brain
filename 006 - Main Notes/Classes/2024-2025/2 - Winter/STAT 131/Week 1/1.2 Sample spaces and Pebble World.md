# Probability and counting

- built upon the use of the [[set]]

## Sample Space
- a [[sample space]] $S$ of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.

### Event
- an [[event]] $A$ is a subset of the sample space $S$, and we say that $A$ occurred if the actual outcome is in $A$.

#### Example of Experiments
- Tossing a coin: {H, T}

#### Full Example
- *Experiment*: Tossing a coin
- *Sample Space*: { H, T }
- *Example of one event*: { H }
