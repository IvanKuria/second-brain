# Chapter 1

## What is a System?

- it's a set of interconnected components that has an expected behavior observed at the interface with it's environment.

## Complexity

### 4 Issues of Complexity

#### Emergent Properties
- properties that show up only when combining individual components
- often it is used in a negative context. i.e *The Millenium Bridge, London*

#### Propagation of Effects
- problems in one component affect other components. i.e [*Northeast Blackout of 1965*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_1965)

#### Not proportional(incommensurate) Scaling
- not all parts of a system scale at the same rate 

#### Tradeoffs
- what will I need to sacrifice for more of something else
