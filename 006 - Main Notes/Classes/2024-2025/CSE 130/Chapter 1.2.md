# Eight Great Ideas in Computer Architecture

## Moore's Law
- [[Moore's law]] states that integrated circuit resources double every 18-24 months.
- important because rather than designing based on where current circuit resources are, we can anticipate where they will be in the future.

## Abstraction
- lower-level details are hidden as a means to offer a simpler model at higher levels

## Make the Common Case Fast
- it's actually more efficient to make the common case fast rather than optimizing the rare case
- *analogy* - it’s surely easier to make a fast sports car than a fast minivan!

## Performance via Parallelism
- computing operations in parallel has led to more performance

## Performance via Pipelining
- it's subset of parallelism
