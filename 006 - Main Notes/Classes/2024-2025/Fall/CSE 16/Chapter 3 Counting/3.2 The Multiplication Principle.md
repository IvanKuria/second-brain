# Counting
### Example 1
- For example, suppose we make a [[list]] of length three having the property that the first entry must be an element of the set {a, b, c}, the second entry must be in {5, 7} and the third entry must be in {a, x}. Thus (a, 5, a) and (b, 5, a) are two such lists. *How many such lists are there all together?*

### Example 2
- A non-repetitive list of length 5 is to be made from the symbols A, B, C, D, E, F, G. The first entry must be either a B, C or D, and the last entry must be a vowel. *How many such lists are possible?*

### Example 3
- Start with 0(A) or start with 1(B)
- Find $${A}\cup{B}$$
	- For this example ${A}\cup{B}$  =\ $\emptyset$, ${|}{A}\cup{B}{|}$ = |A| + |B| = 24

### Example 4
- How many 5 bit vectors start or end with zero?
	- A: sequence that starts with 0, |A| = *16*
	- B: "                      " end with 0, |B| = *16*
	- ${A}\cap{B}$ : sequences that start and end with 0, |${A}\cap{B}$|  = *8*
	- |${A}\cup{B}$| = |A| + |B| - |${A}\cap{B}$ | = 16 + 16 - 8 = *24*
