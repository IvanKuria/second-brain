# Direct Proof

### Example
- *Proposition* If two integers have opposite parity, then their sum is odd. 
	- *Proof*. Suppose m and n are two integers with opposite parity. We need to show that m + n is odd. This is done in two cases, as follows. 
	- *Case 1*. 
		- *Suppose* $m$ is even and n is odd. 
		- *Thus* $m = 2a$ and $n = 2b + 1 $for some integers $a$ and $b$. 
		- *Therefore* $m + n = 2a + 2b + 1 = 2(a + b) + 1$, which is odd (by Definition 4.2). 
	- *Case 2*. 
		- *Suppose* $m$ is odd and $n$ is even. 
		- *Thus* $m = 2a + 1$ and $n = 2b$ for some integers $a$ and $b$. 
		- *Therefore* $m + n = 2a + 1 + 2b = 2(a + b) + 1$, which is odd (by Definition 4.2). 

- The phrase *“Without loss of generality...”* is a common way of signaling that the proof is treating just one of several nearly identical cases.
