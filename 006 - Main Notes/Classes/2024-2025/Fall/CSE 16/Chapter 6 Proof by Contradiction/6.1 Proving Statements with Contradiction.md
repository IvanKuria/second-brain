# Proof by Contradiction

## Rational Def
- A real number $x$ is [[rational]] if $x = a/b$ for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Also, $x$ is irrational if it is not rational, that is if $x  \neq a/b$ for every $a, b \in Z$

### Example 1
- Proposition The number $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. 
	- *Proof*. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it is not true that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. 
	- *Then* $\sqrt{2}$ is rational, so there are integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\sqrt{2} = a / b$ . (6.1) 
	- *Let* this fraction be fully reduced; in particular, this means that a and b are not both even. (If they were both even, then the fraction could be further reduced by factoring 2â€™s from the numerator and denominator and canceling.) 
	- Squaring both sides of Equation 6.1 gives $2 = a^2 b^2$ , and therefore $a^2 = 2b^2$. (6.2)
	- From this it follows that $a^2$ is even. But we proved earlier (Exercise 1 on page 136) that $a^2$ being even implies a is even. 
	- *Thus*, as we know that a and b are not both even, it follows that b is odd. 
	- *Now*, since a is even there is an integer $c$ for which $a = 2c$. 
	- Plugging this value for a into Equation (6.2), we get $(2c)^2 = 2b^2$, so $4c^2 = 2b^2$, and hence $b^2 = 2c^2$. This means $b^2$ is even, so $b$ is even also. But previously we deduced that $b$ is odd. 
	- *Thus* we have the contradiction $b$ is even and $b$ is odd.
