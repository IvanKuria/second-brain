# Proof by Contradiction

## Outline for Proving a Conditional Statement with Contradiction

- Proposition If $P$, then $Q$. 
	- Proof. Suppose $P$ and $∼ Q$. 
	- .
	- .
	- .
	- Therefore $C \wedge ∼ C$.

### Example
- *Proposition* Suppose a ∈ Z. If a^2 is even, then a is even. 
	- *Proof*. For the sake of contradiction, suppose a2 is even and a is not even.
	- *Then* a^2 is even, and a is odd. 
	- *Since* a is odd, there is an integer c for which a = 2c + 1. 
	- *Then* a^2 = (2c + 1)^2 = 4c^2 + 4c + 1 = 2(2c^2 + 2c) + 1, so a^2 is odd. 
	- *Thus* a^2 is even and a^2 is not even, a contradiction.
