## Goal
- help people track what foods they have stored, their quantity and when they expire
- should provide an interface for people to see their groceries and their expiration dates(specifically how many days/months until expiration)
- should send emails to people when their food is about to expire(maybe like 3 days before)
- will let people tag where the food is located(fridge, freezer, pantry)
